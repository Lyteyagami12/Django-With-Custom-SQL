This is a django project inspired from DARAZ- ONLINE SHOPPING MARKET- https://www.daraz.com.bd/

Here we used CX_Oracle for Custom SQL queries and supporting RDBMS is Oracle Database 11g. 

TO RUN THIS PROJECT FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW:


Prequisite: You need to  CONFIGURE PIP ENVIRONMENT on your System/DEVICE  (For more details about pip environment Just google it) and Oracle Database 11g as well

STEP-1:
    
    Clone This Project on your local disk where you prefer to 
    But If you don't understand how to clone a project from GitHub learn about Git Please! There's a lot more information about Git. Just google it.
    
    It's quite simple 

STEP-2:
    
    open windows powershell/cmd on this directory and
    
    then install DJANGO, CX-ORACLE  on the directory where 'manage.py' exists
   
   TO INSTALL DJANGO AND CX-ORACLE:
